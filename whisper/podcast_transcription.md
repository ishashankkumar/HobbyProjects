 The fundamentals of investing hasn't changed at all. Buying great things or great businesses, holding for long periods of time, earning cash returns. What's changed is the environment around it. The whole backbone of the world is changing. Behind your phone or your computer, you can have this podcast on your cell phone and go for run in the morning. How that gets delivered to you is data center storing it, fiber delivering it to you, going to a tower and bringing it down to your phone wireless. And all of that needs enormous amounts of infrastructure and all of that is built by private enterprise. 50% of the backbone of what we own today does not exist as an asset class for investment 20 years ago. Well, you have over a trillion dollars in management now. It sounds like a lot of money. It is a lot of money. It's a trillion dollars. But it's not that much when you do what we do.

As CEO of Brookfield Asset Management, he's quietly spent decades building a trillion dollar business, investing patiently in the invisible machinery of the global economy. While others chase short-term returns, flat position Brookfield is capitalized on massive global shifts from digitalization and low carbon energy to a reshaped global supply chain, years before they appeared on anyone else's radar. In this rare public conversation, it's only the second podcast he's ever done. Flat reveals not just what he invests in, but how he thinks. From spotting trends early, destructuring deals for resilience across economic cycles, to placing big, bold bets that compound steadily over time, he offers a masterclass and patient, disciplined, investing. Whether you're allocating capital, building a business, or simply navigating uncertainty, you'll learn how one of today's most influential but private investors sees around economic corners, and why his ability to ignore short-term noise might be as great as competitive advantage of all. It's time to listen and learn. The opinion shared on this podcast belongs solely to those expressing them. Hosts and guests may hold positions in the securities discussed. This podcast is intended to provide general information only and should not be considered financial advice. I want to start with how investing has changed over the past 23 years, I think, since you've been CEO. Look, on the first level, I'd say it hasn't changed at all. What investing is about is to buy great things or great businesses, holding for long periods of time, earning cash returns. That hasn't changed at all. The fundamentals of investing are exactly the way they were before. What's changed is the environment around it. I mentioned a couple things. First one is many businesses are publicly traded. The indexing of and passive investing has changed the publicly traded market for investments. It's very different than the actual investments. Investments are still the same and what we do is still the same. How they trade in the market and whether they're included in indexes has changed how they trade in the public markets. I think that is probably the fundamental biggest thing. The second thing, and this is, I'd say, maybe the most simple way to say it is, 50% of the things that we invest in today did not exist as an investment asset class for investors like us 20 years ago. 50%. We invest in the backbone of the global economy. These are simple things. We deliver your water in the morning. We told the road you drive on in the afternoon. We deliver your power to your house. The data center that powers your phone, we own. Those are all really backbone things. What we do is backbone. This is not innovative venture capital that we're doing. But 50% of the backbone of what we own today did not exist as an asset class for investment 20 years ago. Our percentage of that would you say is a new things versus governments may be privatizing some of the services they used to deliver. When we started in infrastructure 25 years ago, we were among the first. We thought that it would be governments privatizing. And to some extent it is, and it's not, they're not privatizing because they have a hard time selling assets. What they do is they're just not investing. Therefore, private enterprise takes it up. But the biggest area of investment today is really just the whole backbone of the world is changing. So the digitization of the whole world between behind your phone or your computer. As you know, laptops didn't exist before the internet didn't exist before. Cell phones didn't exist before today. You can have this podcast on your cell phone and go for run in the morning. How that gets delivered to you is data center storing it, fiber delivering it to you, going to a tower and bringing it down to your phone wireless. And all of that needs enormous amounts of infrastructure and all of that is built by private enterprise. Virtually every, all, in fact, not virtually all of that is delivered to you as an individual. And this is 8 billion people in the world getting that delivered to them in various forms. It's all delivered by private money. And, and that's what's changed. It's before historically that was built out by governments today. It's being built out by private enterprise, you know, to use an example. We own all of the telecom towers, not all, but we own a very substantial portion of the telecom towers in India. They deliver all the phone and wireless infrastructure to many individuals in India. And that was originally built by Reliance Industries Geo. We bought it from them and we support there and other telecom companies activities through those telecom towers. And historically that would have been built by government. But it was, that's built by private enterprise. Let's go back to the rise of passive maybe versus historically more active investing. What implications do you see? What opportunities are created? Look, in every, in everything when there's a, when I say there's a problem, there's always an opportunity. And I think that's the Chinese symbol, right? Problem in opportunity. For some companies smaller mid-size, don't fit indexes. They will be lost within public markets investing because active investors may not be investing in those sectors anymore. And if you don't fit the indexes, you have no buyers. Increasingly though, what it's doing is it's creating a large disparity in some securities at points in time between the price of them. The price of them, the market and the value of the underlying assets. Back to you asked me first question, what has changed in the investing world? And I said nothing, that's related to value. What's changed is the price of some things trades up and down. If over the last 18, 24 months, if you've been one of the big technology stocks in the world, everyone needed or wanted to buy you in the indexes and therefore their multiples traded very high. But if you were something that didn't neatly fit the indexes, it traded at a low price. The opportunities are that we can take those companies private. So we took a large container shipping company private. It had one, it had one analyst and nobody following it. It fit in no indexes. It was a six billion dollar company. And we took a private and it's been an exceptional investment. So we continue to capitalize on opportunities where we understand the value and the price is not trading at that in the markets.

What can you do with a private company that you can't do with a public company? Well, firstly, you don't have to look at what the price is versus the value. You just know what the value is and you run it for what it is. But secondly, we can operate differently, finance differently, invest for the future, and run a business like somebody should just run it. If you and I own a business privately, we wouldn't care about the markets. We wouldn't care about whether the stock went up or down tomorrow morning. We just run our business. Cash will come out. We decide should we divin it out to ourselves to use together? Or should we keep it in the business and invest? And that's really the difference is all you look at is the fundamentals of your business, if you're private. And if your public, people tend to get distracted by the trading price of the security. When it's not really relevant, some businesses need access to capital and have to raise capital. And therefore, their price is important. But most businesses that are listed don't need access to capital. They're only listed because they're large. And they happen to be just, they need owners. And therefore, they're in the public markets. They're never issuing equity. And therefore, the price of the security in the market really does matter. And in fact, it's a distraction. Which is why when people often ask me what happened with the alternatives industry and wanted to grow the extent that it grew over the last 25 years. It's really grown that way because private assets are the fundamentals are exactly perfectly matched to the fundamentals of what institutional investors want to have in their portfolios. And maybe even more importantly, by owning them privately, they don't have to have the distraction of the public market. They don't have to get confused that you and I bought a telecom tower business. It generates a 6% yield. It grows at 4% every year. And we don't have to invest much cash flow into it. So it's free cash flow. And if it's privately owned, we just watch the cash flow and keep growing and try to enhance the business and grow it. And that's what we do privately. If it trades in the public market and today it's worth $20 and tomorrow because of whatever happens in the markets, it's worth 10. Nothing changed in the business. And that distraction is what causes people issues. They sometimes make rash decisions. And I'd say that's maybe the biggest enhancement to long-term investors by having private assets. I take it, you're not an efficient market hotpot. This is personal. No, the answer is no. The markets are never efficient. In fact, very seldom do they ever trade at the actual value of securities. Most of the time they trade above or below, very seldom do they trade at the value. But yes, I guess there are many theories in life. Let's talk about some of the trends going on in the world today that you see from your aperture that you think have a long runway that we're maybe just beginning on or maybe in the middle of the innings on. So we generally have three sort of themes that we invest around. We have a few themes we invest around at all points in time today. We have three. The first one is just the digitalization of everything in the amount of capital that's being invested behind that digitalization. And really what it is is there are many, many, many, many trillions of dollars going into the movement of information into the cloud. And so that's the digitalization of everything behind it. And that has been enhanced increased, enhanced by artificial intelligence and the networks being set up now to harness artificial intelligence. And maybe the most simplest way to explain it is everyone thinks of artificial intelligence is chat GPT. I'm going to get it to write my cooking class memorandum. But really what the where the money is going to be made is the application of artificial intelligence into business and simply stated that's taking processes in service and industrial businesses. And making them more efficient by using advanced robotics who have learned how to make, how to run those processes from models run on artificial intelligence. And we're in the very, very early stages of that. But from an infrastructure standpoint, the amount of money being put behind this is in amounts which have almost never been seen invested before. So that's sort of the first theme we have of investment and at both effects are operating businesses because we're we're now applying artificial intelligence in our business to make them better. And they'll be more productive. And we're also investing in supporting and technology companies with their funding for the redigilization of the world. Let's spend a few minutes on digitalization before we move on in the sense of you know there's vast data centers being created today. I would love to hear your thinking on whether that investment is going to be where winners are accrued or we over investing as we typically do in booms and boss. And then walk me through sort of like how you see winners emerging in this from end to end right you generate energy you least data centers you walk me through how you see that. So there's no straight line in investing to success. And usually at points in time people will lose money because they get overexcited. But there's we're in a period of time where this is a major major build out of what's going on. The clear winners in this AI revolution are going to be the major technology companies. That's sort of easy. They're very sophisticated. They have large balance sheets and capital to deploy. They they've already developed models and they're going to be very very they're going to win. They're going to win. They have the data and they have enormous amounts of data. So all of they're going to they're going to win up that that's easy. Like I'm not sure there's anything that I would that that's helpful to you to anyone listening to this. If I tell you, oh, you should buy Google. These are going to be great companies and they're going to continue to be great. The winners that are unknown today are the companies that are going to figure out how to apply artificial intelligence into their businesses and make them better. And there are many businesses today where you cannot get people to operate the businesses. There's just aren't enough people. And if you can therefore deploy robotics into businesses and shrink the amount of labor you need or there are plants that are being operated in Asia that had high dollar value. That's why they went there, but the reason the high dollar value products, but they went there because there was high labor component. If you can shrink the labor component, many of those plants can come back to where the demand is specifically, I'd say the United States. So the unknown winners are going to be the companies that can apply artificial intelligence into their businesses and make them more efficient and more profitable. And I think those that do it will win those that don't some will fall behind. But the productivity advances we see over the next 20 years probably will be unprecedented for a period of time. Certainly one we haven't seen it for a long time in business across America. Is there anybody you're tracking externally that you would never acquire that you admire how they're applying sort of technology? So you know we're in the early early stages of this and so we're trying to learn from everybody. We're talking to many we of course given their scale we have access to very significant resources and we can talk to most people so we talked all the technology greats we deal with all of them in our fundamentally in our business. In addition to that we're continuing to learn and apply these technologies within our business and what I can tell you is the early learnings of our business some of our industrial businesses are and why I have why I can why I say the things I just said to you is that the early learnings are that the advancement of productivity is very very significant. And you see that in your battery like you guys make half the batteries in the world don't you? We make just under half of the car battery so we make the little car battery that starts your car you know when you get up in the morning it doesn't start you have to go get anyone. So that normal time half of those in winter half of those will come from us yeah that are out there and it's an amazing business and we continue to re you know we're always trying to optimize it. Our job is to invest in businesses and make them better so that they will grow greater amounts of cashflow so we can continue invest in the businesses and and provide dividends to our owners. And so we as we try to make these better we're applying artificial intelligence into all our businesses including that battery business which is and why it's a perfect one. For these type of applications is we have 25,000 people in 20 plants we do very repetitive process. And as a result and we have nine billion dollars of costs within the business if you can improve those by 30% that's a lot of money to the bottom line and it can be very significant for the company. Is there another example that stands out about how you're applying AI to the businesses that you control every single business we have. We have a healthcare business where we have we approve your healthcare in the United States if you need a back surgery and you need to authorization from your insurance company to do it we take the phone call from you and we approve it online we approve your hundred fifty thousand dollar operation or not. And our agents do that and today the amount of information we can put up when you call in is incredible even from two years ago is incredible and that just helps us make better decisions quicker and server clients who are the healthcare companies better and but it's everywhere. We're applying these type of things in all the businesses but we're in the first inning of this. So it's anybody that has and started should start the end is not too late we're in the early innings of the application of this. It's exciting to see where it's going so we have a trend of digitalization what other big trends do you see. The second one is that there is a transition of the world to low carbon energy and and I say it that way because what's really important here is we just have less carbon out there and but what's what's even more important today is that solar and wind which is where we're going to have a lot of energy which is what's filling the gap are the lowest cost energy sources for power in the world in most countries today and why that's really important is it doesn't matter whether you choose to have less carbon or don't care about less carbon what you do choose is to pay less for your power. That's the simple economics are today if you go to somebody and say do you want to pay more for your power they will say they will say no I don't want to pay more for the power I'd rather pay less and and as a result of it the lowest cost power in most countries of the world is solar and wind therefore you're going to choose solar wind so it's inexorable that we're going to build out most more solar and wind in the world. In the United States today there's no doubt we're drilling more oil which is remember oil is not used in power oil is used for basically cars chemicals and planes they it goes into jet engine fuel goes into car engine fuel and it goes into chemicals and that has nothing to do with power oils not used for power natural gas is and natural gas is one of the great assets United States has. It's going to export it for a long time it's going to use a lot of it in America eventually batteries and nuclear will be the base load and it won't be natural gas but it's being shipped elsewhere in the world and where it's going to is needed for base load because they they they need that that base load power or it's replacing coal which is hugely beneficial to the world. So natural gas is an incredibly important bridge fuel in America and long term fuel in many other places in the world so the LNG market in the United States is extremely important and very lucrative for a long period of time. Let me make sure I understand this so wind and solar low cost and then gas is sort of the base load wind there's no wind or solar because we don't yet have the batteries to time show. You know we have we have base load capacity in the US which is nuclear that will continue to grow we talk about nuclear if we have time later what's happening in in grids is that you need something to stabilize the grids and to store when because remember solar the sun only signs during the day start usually dark at night and wind actually usually blows at night but we're going to have a lot of time. So we're going to have a lot of time to do things at night but you normally don't have the the incidents of both together are not always the case and you have to have something to bridge one of those and increasingly in past. that and gas has done that. Increasingly battery storage at scale distributed will help both with transmission bottlenecks but also with the two offsetting amounts. How do you see the trend with like data centers in terms of electrical use? Do you see that continuing to be because these take a long time to permit to get into place or do you see that reducing in time? So the reason why one of your questions earlier which I really didn't answer was our data centers are we going to get in trouble with the amount of money that's going into data centers and the answer is no and it's largely because it takes a long time to permit a data center. You need to find power to power the data center and the needs of the technology companies are very significant and on top of that energy usage everywhere is going up and as a result of that it just takes time to bring sites on and most sites today that are available to be built are already contracted to somebody for the next 20 years. So we're at a point in time where it's we're now trying to entitle new sites and we're because of our vast real estate business or vast power business or vast data center business we're as skilled and as integrated as they are to entitle new sites but it takes time and we've got some really exciting large sites coming but these most the earliest big one that's going to come on that's brand new that we're entitling and even though it has enormous advantages because of it already has power it'll be years away. So like all your risk is your de-risk because you're not doing it unless it's contracted out is that? Generally yes we're not we don't we've never we've never had and I don't think we we need to take risk on that and therefore it's like when we build an office building you know you're you you let it to a bunch of tenants then you build it for them and you don't have to take the risk on that in particular in these because of the demand for it. And what's the third trend that you see? So the third trend that we identified a long time ago and I'd say it's changed even more but is more relevant today than ever which is just the de-globalization of industry and I or I'd call it the re-industrialization of countries because of what's going on in the world and that started with COVID it started with the Asia West issues which as you can imagine that one has only the the since week coin that four years ago five years ago it's only increased given what's been going on but increasingly many companies are moving industrial capacity back to Western markets where on balance they can make sense of putting plants there. Part of its forest supply chain pharmaceuticals need now need to be next some of it needs to be next to customer because they get caught during COVID that all of a sudden all my manufacturing in China how do I get it here it can't get out of China what am I going to do. So increasingly those type of things but but also with tariffs and with other things you're going to relocate manufacturing capacity back to to other markets and and be more local and what I would say is things many things went to Asia and a lot of them will stay there and the Asian markets will be fine with this because they've they've now matured to the point where they are service economies in themselves but many products that have been developed there will move back to America because the labor components with robotics coming in are becoming less and less and less so the reason for them to be in Asia is less there today than it's ever been and on top of that if there happens to be a tariff long if there is a tariff longer term then then it's even going to quicken that process. What do you see as the second order either opportunities or challenges to that sort of call it re-patriation of manufacturing. Look I think China it's an economy in itself today it's 1.5 billion people they're getting richer every day they're turning into a consumer service society there's not that much of manufacturing that's relevant to them I think they will they will do extremely well as a country on their own but there are some countries in the world where they haven't yet transformed themselves to be service economies and they're reliant on jobs that were from outsourced manufacturing and if you can do that closer to consumer those countries may have some issues. On balance for western countries I'll just take the US as an example you're bringing some jobs back maybe not as many as left before to make the product but if that product comes back you've actually added jobs and that's very positive which sort of leads to the long-term story of America which is the long-term story of America is extremely strong because the US today has energy capital and technology dominance energy capital and technology dominance there's nobody in the world that has a technology businesses that the US has there's nothing in the world that has the capital markets the US has and the US just by nature has dominance nature and some hard work has dominance in oil in gas in solar and in wind and it has dominance in nuclear and those five things together give it energy dominance in the world for a long long period of time and so I think those three those three things are going to make on top of one of the greatest GDP's in the world an entrepreneurial class manufacturing moving back at least to some extent a lot or to some extent on balance is going to be positive for for a growth the US has a pretty good runway going forward it sounds like you think we're out of an inflection point for productivity and some of the the job losses will be offset by sort of the remanufacturing coming back to the US how do you where do you think we are in that trend like that game I guess there is no straight line in anything everyone always thinks that somebody says something and it's going to happen tomorrow morning usually usually it happens in greater amounts but it takes longer periods of time and takes slower than you think it would happen I would say we're in the early stages of all of this we're seeing going to see productivity advances and nobody just flips a switch thing is not nobody ever flips a switch these are incremental changes over very long periods of time but it's what it means is that this that the application of greater intelligence into businesses is going to make business better more efficient more productive and and better better better for the world frankly that that just makes us all smarter you mentioned real estate how has that changed over the past I would say 10 but specifically five years you know again I would say over the past 25 30 years 10 years five years these things always just evolve and you know industrial capacity used to be just used for manufacturing storage of goods and today it's used for transportation of many goods that are delivered to homes so industrial has changed enormously changed as a business over the past 10 years retail has changed because people used to do all their shopping in stores today what they do is they do very the spoke shopping in stores and they want to experiences in stores but if you want to buy paper towels you usually don't go to the mall you just order it online and but but if you want to have a meal and you want to go and try on a shirt or pair of pants or have some fun for the afternoon you go to the mall and that's that's what's changed is that commodity goods if you own commodity if you want almost today commodity anything it's bad if you own commodity office bad you own commodity retail bad you own commodity industrial bad in fact if you own commodity hotels bad if you what's great today is all of those things in the top 25% and our our view always has been by the best on the best by the best continue to reinvest into the best and so our real estate is among the best in the world and we continue to experience some some great numbers look over the last five years because of covid and because other things and because interest rates went up by 400 500 base points all of that disrupted the real estate market but the the worst is behind us by far we're looking in the rear view mirror by by what happened in real estate and in fact this time the fundamentals are actually pretty good in most things it's just there are some people that have capital structures that aren't built for these financing markets and therefore they have to put capital in to be able to deliver it or whatever they have to do or or somebody also take over the asset but that's not a huge issue across the world I think a lot of it systems how to build them optimize them and make them more efficient but efficiency isn't just about productivity it's also

netherflame sauce now available with a Minecraft movie meal I participate in McDonald's for a limited time a Minecraft movie only in theaters maybe spend a few minutes and sort of like take me behind the scenes and how you think about risk and how you think about interest rates and how you think about debt when it comes to assets our our fundamental thesis of investing is that you should put a prudent amount of debt on assets that can withstand markets if you can then you should fix it because you know your cost and and from time to time if you got it wrong you put a little make sure you have a little more money around to put it in and and support your asset so we've always conservatively financed our businesses and assets all of our financing is asset by asset by asset by asset or business by business by business by business so any debt that we accumulate on or consolidated balance sheet is just the accumulation of a whole bunch of single asset financings and and it's not that we ever want to or think that we will give back assets or not live up in fact our reputation is with our lenders is that we're one of the best sponsors in the world to borrow lend money to because we support our businesses but buying have having asset by asset by asset financing allows you to just deal with the situation one by one by one and and it's duration mean they're spread over long long periods of time and and with interest rates I think the most important thing to remember is we don't borrow the treasury rate only the government borrows at treasury rates and what we borrow at is treasury rate plus spread yeah and historically spreads were 200 basis points and interest rates were 300 basis points and therefore you borrowed it five and when co when covid hit interest rate the treasury rate went to zero and what the bor most of the lenders said to us is I'm not going to lend to it at 200 over and give you three I'm widening that out to to 350 so I'll give you five and or four and a half and therefore before we're borrowing at five and in covid we're borrowing at four and a half so when people say oh jeez you've got all this financing in covid yes maybe some people did and some people got very low rates because rates were zero and they might have borrowed it to at an extreme point in time but not very much and most of it lenders just widened the spread out today base rates are high we're back to five guess what spreads are the lowest they've ever been in history we just did a 30 year Brookfield Corporation financing so we're borrowing money for 30 years fixed for that time period and is 125 over so spreads spreads basically all in coupons are important and and that's really important to remember about investing in real assets real estate but also infrastructure renewables etc what distortions do you see by sort of like historically low interest rates and even by today's standards you mentioned they went up they they have gone up quite a bit but historically they're still well below average yeah look i think the him that's that that maybe is the most important point to note here is that interest rates aren't that high they're higher than they were because interest went to zero and for a number of years after the financial crisis they were close to zero and now they're actually in a normal a relatively normal range i'm sure we're going to see another few hundred few another 50 hundred base points off of the short rates and we're going to settle into just a regular range of rates but these rates are actually pretty normal and for our business very constructive and the things that we can do and we're refinancing it because the coupons aren't that much different than what they were before people we talked about sort of dislocations providing opportunities and you know maybe spend a few minutes walking me through how you think of positioning to manage the recycle but not only maintain your assets but also take advantage of dislocations in the market so the first thing one has to do when they're dislocations in the market is make sure that you have been you were prepared for it so the one thing you should do always when times are really good is ensure that you're preparing for the down markets that's coming the ones that don't usually aren't successful in the fullness of time but if you are prepared the first order of business is let's double down and make sure that we're fully prepared but then secondly and and and and I'd say coming out of recessions or cycles coming out of the bottom what's the most important is just have everything you have intact do not lose anything do not lose too much and keep going because there'll be many people who will lost stuff what's even better to enhance the business is at that point in time as the markets starting to recover and once you're comfortable we've taken care of all the things within our business that you can then invest capital into new businesses at that point in time and add to your entity and if you can that's the difference between the great winners and long-term investing and the and those that are just in the you have almost well you have over a trillion dollars in management now how do you fend off the pressure to deploy that money it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money it sounds like a lot of money it's a trillion dollars but it's not that much when you do what we do a few years ago we bought Deutsche Telekom's half a Deutsche Telekom's telekom to our business in Germany and Austria's 20 billion dollar transaction we're building for Microsoft 13 billion dollars of power plants we're building with Intel a 32 billion dollar fabrication plant in Arizona you know I can go through the list these are large transactions that consume significant amounts of capital that earn excellent long-term returns and I've just used that to say we're we've been doing this a long time what we promise our investors and our clients is that we will take moderate amounts of risk not no risk but moderate amounts of risk and earn good good returns over long periods of time we won't shoot the lights out you're not going to get 45% returns every year um and we're not trying for that but average returns over and above average period of time equal outstanding returns yeah and that's the point the point is we've earned our parent companies earn 19% return annualized returns for 30 years uh when you compound up which doesn't sound like very much 19% returns annualized for 30 years like it just when you say that in that line that sound like that much but I think that's a million dollars became almost two hundred million dollars over that period of time or a thousand dollars became two hundred thousand dollars it's a lot and uh so so the point is success in investing isn't about making a lot of money in a short period of time what it's really about is earning reasonable returns over very long periods of time and look that's Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire Hathaway successful because um they have been able to deploy capital at reasonable amounts of turn over very long periods of time and uh and that's the success of long-term investing is that a company you look up to look they've done an incredible job in their business over a very long period of time maybe you mentioned over 30 years walk me through a little bit of the history of Brookfield and then the future where we're going so we started as an operating business we just invested for ourselves um we had the businesses that we basically have today uh infrastructure real estate renewables and industrial service we call private equity businesses and credit lending those were our five businesses we did it for ourselves and we lent money and um 25 years ago we decided that we could take those skills we had and turn them into a business to be able to manage some of our money and some of our institutional or other clients money and um and offer alternatives into those funds when it started nobody wanted to invest with us because they didn't really understand alternatives and today um that's turned into a trillion dollar business um it's been extremely successful largely because um these products are ideal for institutional and retail clients to invest into and the the past 25 years has been about institutional and and this comment is not meant to say that they won't be investing but they're they're increased from going from zero to some of them are at 30 40 50% alternatives um when you go from zero to 50 you can't go to 100 so a lot of them are at their numbers but what's happening today and and your question of the future is that the same phenomena is now happening in retail uh retail being individuals. For on case in the US are going to open up two alternatives i think plans around the world will open up two alternatives uh alternatives are ideal products for retail as well in fact they're almost more ideal because you're saving for your retirement and uh what better to have in there than a product that earns a reasonable return over a very long term long period of time and can compound and so the the future of our asset management businesses really about um that um the opening up of retail and continued growth of retail wealth with our products doing the same things that we do for institutions exact same but now just opening up in different types of products that are suited or tailored for um individuals. What does that mean maybe walk me through it because you know I've always thought you've had these available to people i could go buy a broke field infrastructure on the public market. You can buy it in the public market that fits in a stock portfolio but you to date we haven't offered you a product for your 401k in the private market okay that was open to you to say do you want to buy um infrastructure with us and just own a bunch of data centers and different things like that um we happen to have a couple of listed ones that are very unique but but uh what people want is private assets within their portfolios and that's going to increase I'd say exponentially over the next 20 years. So retail is sort of the future but another big area that you're investing in is insurance maybe walk me through some of the opportunities you see over the next 20 or 30 years and insurance. Yeah so outside of our as a management business we decided to um take a portion of our capital and um put it into insurance five years ago was a fortuitous time because we bought some um excellent insurance companies at a point in time where they weren't doing very well because interest rates were extremely low and they weren't earning very high returns on their capital fast forward four years later the companies are doing extremely well we're making two billion dollars a year of cash flow within the business and um and insurance for us is is um I'd say the following firstly and maybe just go back our goal was get in the insurance business not not because we want to to be an insurance what our goal is is our clients come to us because they um they want our investment skills what we have is a very unique offering is a bunch of investment skills that can create products um for long-term investors uh our insurance company now being uh 120 billion dollars of assets is a perfect long-term uh investor into all of the things we do from our asset management business so we have a special um special expertise to be able to offer because we have access to our investment products or great we have greater access or greater comfort with all the investment products to be able to put into the insurance companies than most other uh groups out there maybe there's a few other others like us but not very many and um therefore we have a special benefit for that so we we've chosen annuities um in the United States largely so far we've now just got licensed in the uh United Kingdom um but why do you use what it heals to you it's just because they're they're low risk liabilities we we're not taking on high risk on the liabilities side our goal originally what was in getting into this was don't take risk on the liabilities earn a money on the asset side and um and we have this unique ability to earn excess returns on the asset side and our goal was put very significant amounts of capital and over capitalize the businesses which allows us to do things in the on the asset side of the balance sheet which is very um different than many insurance companies and what what you know we we can own real estate uh to a greater extent we can all know alternatives to a greater extent we know infrastructure to a greater extent um we can own high yield bonds as opposed to just uh fixed income on the market um all the things that we do for our clients um we can put them into insurance company and they may take more capital but we've over capitalized the company so we started with four billion dollars we've increased the capital i think the seven sixteen seventeen billion dollars of book equity um within the business we continued over capitalize but on top of that we have another hundred billion hundred and fifty billion dollars of capital up top that if we need more money we'll put it into insurance companies to ensure they're healthy and better than any that are out there and um and we have an excellent relationship with the regulators um and explain all these things to them and are very transparent with all the transactions we do with them um and we happen to have some very unique things that we can do because you know for example if we own an office building and somebody owns the other half and they want to sell and we know that's a really cheap uh price they're going to sell at um that's a great real estate investment for our for our insurance company very seldom do people have that opportunity with our knowledge and access to opportunities so it's a pretty unique um offering and and that's what we bring to the table do you think you'll get out of annuity while staying annuities but expand into other businesses i am imagining short duration stuff is probably the property and casualties is not doesn't lend itself to that type of investing but maybe reinsurance or yeah look i i would say we wanted to start this is a 25 year venture uh we're five years in um we wanted to start to make sure that we uh uh knew what we were doing we met all our regulators we uh earned their respect um and we um we operate we could operate and figure out what were all the risks um we've been in it five years were very comfortable over time uh we may branch out into other types of uh other products that we can understand that fit our skill set and um and that's really what's important to us so first we're expanding internationally writing annuities or pension risk transfer annuities which are both are very similar uh so instead of instead of going out of our uh comfort zone on the type of liability what we're doing today is we're expanding to the uk and which is a big uh pension risk transfer market and that that's just a different way to expand are the pension risk defined benefit or defined contributions these are uh pension risk transfer means which happens in the us candidate in the uk large e those three places in the world um what it means is that if there's a corporation that has a defined benefit plan that wants to get it off their balance sheet so they they have a ten billion dollar plan there's 10 billion assets 10 billion liabilities they can commute that plan to us and we can our insurance company can take it so they're no longer on hook for the plan they're no longer uh at risk on the assets or the liabilities we've assumed that risk we will now pay their pensioners and they gave us the assets to earn over time hopefully the the amount of money to pay all their pensioners and if not we're on the hook for it not them can you spend a few minutes walking me through the machinery of Brookfield and why you've structured it the way you have i would just say um like one i'll i'll preface this with like one of the criticisms from the outside in is that it's super complicated there's a lot of different entities and moving parts how do you think through that so i would just say that uh yes there are probably more pieces of Brookfield for samod i might disagree first by saying there there are many companies in the world that are large like us and they have as many many pieces as we do that's first point so i'm not sure that's actually a true statement but i'll take your uh i'll take your uh points at at face value and i would just say each one of the pieces we've set up has been highly thought through and contributes a lot to the business these are not random things we've done they're very specific and they contribute enormous value in the long term to the company and because of that um we have to explain them more to maybe sometimes have to explain them more to investors but for our friends they understand exactly why those pieces are there and what they do for us and um and what each accomplishes in the short term i could we could wave a wand and get rid of all those as you denote complicated parts we can wave a wand get rid of them all in the in the long term it would be bad for shareholders less less returns would be earned we would be more at um financial risk we would have we we have the maximum amount of flexibility within our structure to be able to go through deal with opportunities risks and everything is out there so i i just i i uh i look we can always do better on explaining the pieces and and we try all the time and it's incredibly important our our reputations incredibly important to us um so when people criticize us about our structure our different things that are there um we try to double down and make sure we explain it all to people um but what i i would just say that each of those pieces is really important and uh and contribute a lot to the business hypothetically if you were to all put it under one umbrella how would that change the opportunity set available to you it would just mean delusion to some shareholder and and and for example we spun off our asset management business uh two years ago there's a whole group of us investors largely that buy asset management businesses that only want to be invested in asset management they don't want to own assets that we own they don't want to be invested insurance they don't want to do all the other things we do um they don't want to change like our our parent company broke field corporation it has changed in 35 years in many different ways in many different times for the benefit of all of us but you need to you need to trust us when we're changing for field asset management is a pure play as a management business that's asset light that will probably never be anything different you can trust us for that and that's what it is so there's just there's just different audiences and um and it just allows us to have a security which is tailored to that audience and if we want to offer it to somebody in the public markets or to and or to another alternative manager we want to merge in or something it gives us the opportunity to do that and not have to deal with all the other issues that we have well what about your insurance business or what about your investments or what what are you going to do next and uh and it just allows us to do that so i don't like we could do it it just would take away a lot of the great benefits we have in the organization if you put your investor Bruce hat on which of the businesses do you think is the best positioned for the next 15 years and i'm not asking returns i just mean which business do you think is the best competitively positioned i just think they're all different they're all totally different everything we invest into has enormous opportunity going forward as long as we execute properly um but there each one of them's different uh i i get excited i could i could get excited about having all of my net worth in every single one of them and uh and they're all pretty exciting going forward maybe spend a few minutes on talent and people in Brookfield is known to take really big bets with what from the outside looking in would be young people what do you see in people that gives you the confidence to take bets in them how do you build a culture where uh meritocracy rises and people can take big bets so we've always had the view that um well firstly we're an extreme meritocracy uh this is a partnership it's partnership individuals uh when when we leave the partnership are shares that if you're an owner or controller of the partnership they go away they go on to somebody else so um nobody's family will ever uh will ever be part of this partnership it's a meritocracy second we've always had the view that um across between uh uh wise older people and smart aggressive young people both um give you the gravitas to deal with situations which you need a little history but also allow you to be um allow you to know more about what's going on today i'm positive our 30 year olds today in the business know more about technology than i do because they've grown up with it differently um it allows us to be faster better quicker to every new trend in the world and what's going on out there and it also i'd say creates a culture where people want to be here and get ahead because they know they can and um and so i look we uh brought to the partners and to our senior people uh three years ago we brought Connor Teske forward as the next person that will be the CEO of the asset management business um that was internally uh vetted it was then externally vetted and today we're in the process of him uh continuing to meet clients and investors and all those kind of things and i think he's 37 years old today um he's incredibly passionate talented and uh and he'll bring through a whole new group of people within the company and re-energizing businesses is what makes them better and different walk me through some of those meetings where you're making a big investment decision what goes on behind the scenes how do you quantify risk where do you spend your time on deal our uh our investment process is we only invest in things that we deal with and know we have people on the ground and our knowledge of the business and um and we're our investment committees are normally only focused on downside protection and upside will always take care of itself and whether you shoot for 16% 22 29 18 none of those matter they're all great what's really important is what are the risks how what can go wrong how bad could it get and um and how do we deal with it if that happens and so we spend virtually all of our time on downside protection at our investment committees and that's all that's important to us when you're wrong where are you typically wrong and you haven't been wrong a lot no no look we make mistakes we try to make small mistakes i'd say that's it when we're wrong where we wrong we're wrong in increment in small ways um which aren't have you you don't know about very much because in the last 35 years we've been right generally on the large things and nothing has been uh irreparably harmful uh harmful and um and that's because the things we do are small incremental and when we make mistakes we we we make them along the way and we encourage people to keep learning and and growing because if you don't make some mistakes you never advance but do not make big mistakes and that's i'd say that's the biggest thing we try um to impress across the organization you mentioned the investment committee i just wonder behind the scenes are investment decisions signed off by by one person or is it a committee that signs off and if it's a committee how do you hope people accountable or responsible for those so our uh usually what happens is some transaction came into the company some way or we had an idea and we don't talk to somebody and transaction came about uh it's been approved by today because we have these vast businesses it's approved in the business but then we have one committee that it's almost like an allocation committee up top because we want to know how many across the organization we want to know how many transactions are happening at any one point in time so we're not compromising like you said how could you make a mistake if everybody made a massive transaction at the same point in time what we're probably betting on is a cycle and you may not like want that and if you do you better knowingly do it and um so in addition to all the deals being approved down below where accountability comes from uh we have an oversight committee that proves everything that goes on in the organization which includes six rate of us and uh and that approves everything really just to have be a final governor over the entire organization are there patterns to cycles that you notice in advance of them happening where you're like we're at the first inning or at the late stages what are the signs that you look for i would just say that uh cycles are never the same but they sort of rhyme and they look similar so um the one thing of having wise older guys around i'll consider myself that today uh uh i used to be a young unwise individual uh i'll try to consider my I know i'm old just not sure i'm wise but uh i um some of the reason for having the the wiser individual around is is having the um elongated knowledge of what goes on in cycles and what goes on in periods and and we've seen this before is helpful sometimes it's a hindrance sometimes it's very helpful for context and uh and therefore that's that that's what makes great organizations i think in our view is that you have um the combination of the tenacity and passion to make investments and be successful tempered by um the uh knowledge and skills of past and what's gone wrong to be able to bring together risk management and drive to succeed i'm curious like how you would teach me to that knowledge of cycles like how would you pass that on to somebody in your organization or me if you were to sort of hear the things i look for don't look for or you know i would say uh in general we don't do training quote unquote but every day every single person in this organization is learning and it's a it's a learn by osmosis process we have open plan uh in the place including myself never had an office and uh and people talk to one another and it's very interactive and therefore while i started off by saying we don't train anybody uh we train them every single day and uh it's just different than sending people to school do you like post mortems after an investment and what's the experience especially the bad ones what goes into those like walk me through that take me behind the scenes and we try to look at it look the the uh successful ones you can usually identify and know what happened the unsuccessful ones are harder to identify what happened um but often there are there are reasons why and it either comes down to execution uh you didn't you didn't execute properly um you had um you missed time the market or you just made a bad bad flawed investment decision and those are the worst you missed time the market yeah you know it's okay um but uh making flawed investment decisions is really bad is that where you you've got the business strength wrong the competitive dynamics wrong you don't understand i just sometimes it's we're sometimes we're pushing out into areas which are adjunct to what we do we probably shouldn't have we really didn't know what we're doing and um not often does it happen but once in a while how how much of your investment decision you focus on the downside but how much of it is like we're modeling it the next five years and then we're tracking to that model or the only thing i tell you about a model is produced in an investment committee is it will never be exactly what happens um but uh i'd say if you get the we're trying to get the trends right is really what it is is in investing it's can you get the trend right and and i would say most of our investing is uh we're trying to get the price right for value and therefore often we're buying at a discount to what we think is the value of something and um and therefore that's an an important thing to note how do you think about the geopolitical risk we we invest in backbone infrastructure largely and even our private equity businesses are backbone infrastructure type businesses therefore what's important for us is to go to good countries with good people that you can operate with the standards we operate with and that those countries respect rule of law and will over time be good places to invest we don't really sell over borders so in the United States where we are um we own data centers and telecom towers and real estate and industrial facilities and all of the things that we own in the US and we make batteries and we etc all all of those are consumed by individuals or companies in the United States they're not shipped we make power it's used within state um so politics don't really matter to us you know they do in the margin but on balance as long as you invest in a good country um you're going to be fine and by good I'm assuming you mean stable rule of law how do you think you're good good means um for us it has to be large enough to build invest we like we can't have small countries just not because they're not good they're not good place to invest it's just not meaningful to us when you have a trillion dollar things the benefit or the um uh the or the undrop yeah the drawback is that uh is that you can't go to a little country like we just we can't invest that uh uh a hundred million dollars it's not relevant to us right um so we need large places we'd like them to have uh we need to operate with a standard so we operate globally with um we need to be we would like to have large GDP we'd like to have a growing uh and we'd like to have a currency that's relatively i didn't have to it doesn't have to grow better than everyone else just has to stay consistent if it's highly volatile not good if it goes down over the long periods of time bad um so we'd we'd rather pick countries with those um those factors and but it all comes down to price like some some have all that and then you do you invest uh when you can but but for us we have to have people on the ground so we pick those countries very methodically we put people on the ground we invest from time to time new investments when we find the opportunities but we don't randomly go to countries like this is not a random business this is hard work therefore we have to be in country be able to action an opportunity when it comes and therefore if we're not in a country and somebody calls us with an opportunity we just say sorry we're not set up to do that can't no can do it seems like part of your secret sauce is not only doing that in advance but also you seem to prove the model before you take outside investors into it you know i like i would say we have a large amount of capital ourselves we've always invested ourselves we want to make mistakes with our own money first um not with others our reputation with our clients is the only thing we have and uh and that's really important to us and and we try to incrementally grow to prices for example we we have a massive platform in the united states so we started insurance in the united states now we're going to the uk to do the same thing we did in the united states and we just got licensed to do that but it um we now have all the experience we have from the united states we probably couldn't have started there right because we just didn't have the same presence there as we had here we always end these interviews with this same question which is what is success for you? Brookfield is one of the great investment management groups in the world today and 20 years from today success is that it is bigger broader more relevant to clients and continues to do exactly what it does today for everybody and earn reasonable returns with with downside risk protected and if we can do that we'll have felt success of all of this thanks for listening and learning with us the front-end straight blog is where you can learn more about my new book clear thinking turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results it's a transformative guide that hands you the tools to master your fate sharpen your decision making and set yourself up for unparalleled success learn more at fs.blog slash clear until next time
